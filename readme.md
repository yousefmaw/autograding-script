### python script and verilog test bench built to auto grade a verilog FSM assignment in the logic design course
- Assignment 4.pdf is the assignment description.
- the script tests for the following three cases:
    1. output = one before 12 clk 
    2. output = zero with right seq
    3. output = one with wrong seq
- the script saves an excel sheet with every row consists of the BN and the state of the three cases tested for the code sumbitted by the BN
